### Frontend/Hybrid Developer

## A little bit about me.
I like to think of myself as a developer committed to continuous learning: I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to improve my skills and knowledge.

During my education in Madrid, I had the honor of being one of the top students in my class in Multiplatform Application Development. Since then, I have continued to expand my knowledge and skills in various areas of computer science, focusing particularly on hybrid apps. I stay up-to-date with online courses and other learning resources to ensure that I am always at the forefront of the latest technologies.

My passion for technology and my personality have allowed me to develop a strong understanding of frontend technology, as well as other areas of computer science. Additionally, my experience with sports, mathematics, and music has provided me with additional skills.

I am always looking for new opportunities to grow and advance as a person and a professional. If you're interested, I invite you to connect with me!
Thanks for stopping by!
